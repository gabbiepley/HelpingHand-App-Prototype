#HelpingHand 

HelpingHand is a website that makes it easier to find non-profit organizations near you and then log the  service hours you have completed. This website is different than other volunteering applications due to the fact that it is user oriented. We hope you can now easily find interesting volunteering opportunities near you  and then efficiently track the hours you complete!
